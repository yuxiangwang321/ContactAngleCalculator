~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ March 1, 2022 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first version of the code was uploaded.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ December 5, 2024 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New version cac-cg-20241205.tcl was uploaded.
Main change: A new parameter "substrateSelection" was added into the command, now the code should be used in following format

cac file_1 file_2 type firstFrame lastFrame step substrateSelection dropletAtomRange atomNumberInMol dropletMolNumDensity glRatio sphereFactor thicknessFactor sliceFactor

example command: cac all.psf all.dcd xz 900 1000 20 {resname SUB} {resname TIP3} 3 0.0324 0.1 3 0.5 0.5

The users must explicitly specify the selection of substrate where the droplet will wet on. The benefit is that if the droplet is a mixture of water and ions (or other molecules), you can still use the code by new commnand. Previous code treats the all atoms other than water atoms as part of the substrate, this leads to wrong results and calculation crash.
